JS-TIPZ
=======

Congrats. You found the ultra super secret repo where I keep all my javascript tips that I post onto my Twitter account. Hooray!

I kept it public as a way to preserve knowledge and little quick tips so future generations of developers can soak up all the stuff I've learned over the years.

Go ahead, jump in, play with it, have fun :). Submit your own if you really want :)
