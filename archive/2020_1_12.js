// Breakpoint debugging? Just add `debugger;`
// and it's off the the races!

const onClick = event => {
  // I need to see if this click event is working:
  event;
  debugger;
  // When this statement runs (in Chrome), the DevTools
  // will pop up and I can hover over 'event' to see the value
  // of it in real time!
